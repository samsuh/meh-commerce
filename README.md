# Meh Clothing e-Commerce Site

This project is a showcase of developing an e-commerce site from scratch with a focus on full-stack architecture, and front-end styling. 

## The Meh Clothing project uses the following technologies: 
- React, using create-react-app, react-router, redux, asynchronous redux-thunk, redux-saga, HOCs, react hooks, 
- Firebase, for authentication and firestore as a NoSQL database
- GraphQL, to query or mutate the database
- SCSS, Sass for component styling 
- Stripe, for payment processing
- Heroku, for deployment

### Minor deviations explored in this project 
- Explicitly separated folder structure; "component-name.component.js" and "component-name.styles.scss" alternate naming convention
- /components and /pages distinction
